## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Disclaimer
The audit makes no statements or warranties regarding the utility, safety, or security of the code, the suitability of the business model, investment advice, endorsement of the platform or its products, the regulatory regime for the business model, or any other claims about the fitness of the contracts for a particular purpose or their bug-free status. 
    
    
### 1.2 Executive Summary
CryptoLegacy is a multichain dApp with a minimalist architecture, designed to secure crypto inheritance in the event of unforeseen circumstances. It uses individual smart contracts that do not store funds but provide maximum security by transferring assets from primary wallets to designated beneficiaries in predefined proportions. The system also supports recovery options via assigned guardians and recovery addresses.

The audit was conducted over 8 days by 4 auditors, involving a thorough manual code review of the scope and analysis via automated tools.

We analyzed the following potential attack vectors:

* **Parameters Misconfiguration**
  We checked whether updates to protocol parameters (e.g., beneficiary list, distribution config, plugin list) could create configurations that unintentionally lock the system or make future updates impossible due to revert conditions or excessive gas costs.

* **Fee-Model Bypass**
  We assessed whether the mechanism enforcing time-based fees could be bypassed by participants who maintain control or delay actions without incurring the intended costs.

* **Stale-Quorum Voting**
  We reviewed whether outdated or removed members could continue to affect quorum or influence voting outcomes due to stale state or lack of revocation enforcement.

* **Percentage-Math Overflow**
  We verified whether any arithmetic using percentages or basis points could overflow, underflow, or lead to unexpected rounding behavior that affects system correctness.

* **Gas-Limited ETH Transfers**
  We assessed ETH transfers that rely on the 2,300 gas stipend to see if they could fail when sent to contracts with fallback logic that requires more gas.

* **Fixed-Gas External Call**
  We examined external calls made with fixed gas amounts to determine whether those limits could cause failures, especially under upstream upgrades or increased gas costs.

* **Unbounded-Loop Exhaustion**
  We looked for loops over dynamic or growing arrays that may lead to out-of-gas reverts, potentially rendering some protocol paths unusable.

* **Silent-Failure Masking**
  We reviewed code paths that catch low-level call failures or use unchecked call results to identify if critical failures could be silently ignored.

* **Shared-Slot Collision**
  We assessed storage layout across delegate-call-based modules to determine if storage slot collisions could occur, leading to state corruption.

* **Selector Shadowing**
  We evaluated whether duplicate function selectors across facets could unintentionally override each other, causing unexpected behavior.

* **Raw-Call Accounting Drift**
  We checked if low-level call results were accurately tracked to prevent marking failed calls as successful, especially in proxy or execution contexts.

* **Sentinel-Index Misuse**
  We checked for patterns where lookups return sentinel values (e.g., max uint256 or 0) and whether those could be misinterpreted by downstream logic.

* **Bulk-Transfer Failures**
  We analyzed whether bulk-transfer methods could fail entirely due to a single failure within the batch, resulting in partial execution or DoS.

* **Re-entrancy**
  We examined if calls across plugins could re-enter state-changing logic in ways that bypass reentrancy protections.

* **Unvetted-Plugin Injection**
  We reviewed logic for facet/plugin registration to assess whether untrusted or misconfigured code could be introduced via upgrades by users.

* **Deployment Attack**
  We verified that the deployment procedures do not allow an attacker to intervene or perform malicious actions.

* **Correct Handling of Beneficiary Switch Procedure**
  We verified the correct handling of the procedure for switching the beneficiary to another hash, in the context of fair token claiming and quorum integrity.

* **Handling of Non-Standard Token Behaviors and Unsolicited Transfers**
  We verified that the system correctly handles rebaseable and fee-on-transfer tokens, as well as unsolicited donations, ensuring accurate accounting and protocol stability. We also confirmed fair distribution among beneficiaries, including vesting, under these conditions.

* **Hashed Address Obfuscation**
We examined the systemâ€™s use of Keccak-256 hashes for address obfuscation and assessed whether this approach protects the privacy of users. 

Besides these, other vectors from our internal security checklist were also reviewed as part of the assessment.

Additionally, the audited codebase interacts with external contracts such as `CryptoLegacyBuildManager.sol` and `BeneficiaryRegistry.sol`, which were outside the scope of this audit and therefore were not reviewed.

To enhance the overall robustness and quality of the codebase, we suggest considering the following improvements:

- Use **ERC-7201** for storage layout naming instead of hashing plain strings, to improve consistency and maintainability.
- Replace magic numbers with named constants to enhance code readability and simplify future maintenance.
- Optimize loops to reduce gas costs. Specific cases and recommendations are outlined in the corresponding finding below.
- Implement a function to modify the `cls.defaultFuncDisabled` variable. Currently, `CryptoLegacyBasePlugin.beneficiaryClaim` cannot be disabled. It's important to ensure this configurability is added in future versions.
- Remove unused and duplicate import statements to improve code readability.

These and other code quality improvements are also reflected in the findings section.

#### 1. Rebaseable Tokens Cause Unfair Vesting and Claim Failures

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/36c75d8528ac3685bf18196a03a01d5072d33644
##### Description
This issue has been identified within the `_claimTokenWithVesting` function of the **CryptoLegacyBasePlugin** contract, specifically related to its interaction with rebaseable ERC-20 tokens.

The function calculates the `amountToDistribute` at the time of each claim by summing the contract's *current* token balance and the `totalClaimedAmount`. This method leads to incorrect outcomes when the token balance changes due to rebasing events occurring *between claims* by different beneficiaries or between partial claims by the same beneficiary.

Two primary problems arise:
1.  **Unfair Distribution:** If a positive rebase occurs after partial claims, the calculation based on the current balance unfairly distributes the rebase gains. Depending on the claim timing relative to the rebase, this can disproportionately benefit or penalize beneficiaries compared to a scenario where gains are distributed across all original shares.
    * For example, if A and B have 50% shares each of 1000 tokens, A claims 250. 
    * Later, the token exchange rate doubles, meaning the remaining 750 tokens rebase to 1500, and claimed 250 tokens by A rebase to 500. 
    * When B claims, `amountToDistribute` becomes `1500 + 250 = 1750`. B gets `50% of 1750 = 875`. A claims the rest and gets `1750 * 50% - 250 = 625`. 
    * A received `625 + 500 = 1125` total, B received `875` total.
2.  **Failed Claims:** If a negative rebase occurs *after* an early claim, the recalculated `amountToDistribute` might imply a remaining entitlement exceeding the actual tokens held by the contract. This will cause subsequent `safeTransferFrom` calls for other beneficiaries to revert due to insufficient balance.

Moreover, it was identified that if `lrWithdrawTokensFromLegacy` in **LegacyRecoveryPlugin** is called to remove tokens from the contract after some tokens have already been partially claimed by beneficiaries, it may lead to issues when those beneficiaries attempt to claim their remaining tokens. In such cases, the vestedAmount might be less than the claimedAmount, potentially causing a temporary underflow.

The issue is classified as **High** severity because it breaks the principle of fair proportional distribution for vested rebaseable tokens and can lead to claim failures.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend calculating entitlements based on fixed shares applied to the current contract balance at the time of claim, ensuring proportional distribution of rebases across all originally vested tokens.

> **Client's Commentary:**
> Client: The failed claims scenario caused by negative rebases has been fully resolved. Specifically, we addressed the case where a rebase could reduce the token balance below the calculated entitlement, leading to unclaimable or locked tokens. As for the unfair distribution scenario involving positive rebases, we believe this does not require changes, based on the following considerations: The observed behavior is a consequence of using rebaseable tokens in a pull-based, asynchronous claim system. Any such system would experience similar effects when token balances change between claims. CryptoLegacy makes no assumptions about token supply stability and simply reflects the current state of the token at the time of claim, ensuring deterministic behavior without overengineering around external token mechanics. Most beneficiaries interact with standard ERC-20 tokens. Designing for perfect rebase fairness would introduce complexity and constraints irrelevant for the vast majority of use cases. Claims remain accurate relative to the contractâ€™s live balance, and all entitlements are correctly enforced within the rules of the vesting schedule and distribution logic. This behavior is consistent with how other decentralized systems handle dynamic tokens and does not compromise the correctness, safety, or reliability of the platform. https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
> MixBytes: Another problem that arises is that with a minimal rebase (down to 1e9), an underflow may occur during claiming. This happens when the actual balance becomes lower than `td.amountToDistribute`, due to the second condition: `(balanceDiff * 1 gwei / bal) < 1e3`.

### 2.3 Medium

#### 1. Incorrect Handling of Guardian Votes in TrustedGuardiansPlugin

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
The TrustedGuardiansPlugin does not correctly handle cases where a guardian who has already voted is later removed from the guardian set.

Currently, the plugin simply checks if the number of votes (guardiansVoted.length) meets the required threshold, without verifying whether those votes came from currently active guardians. As a result, votes from removed guardians may still be counted, potentially causing quorum to be reached prematurely.

In addition, public view functions that expose the list of votes or voting guardians may return outdated or misleading data, since they donâ€™t exclude votes from removed guardians. This may cause incorrect assumptions when the data is consumed off-chain.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend updating the vote validation logic so that only votes from guardians who are active at the time of resolution are taken into account when checking for quorum.

Additionally, we suggest reviewing any public view functions that expose voting data, and considering adjustments to ensure they return only valid, up-to-date votes.

> **Client's Commentary:**
> This issue has been fully resolved in the smart contract: removed trusted guardians are now automatically cleared from guardiansVoted, ensuring their votes are no longer counted in quorum calculations or shown in public state.

#### 2. Front-running `beneficiarySwitch` Can Block Beneficiary Removal (DoS)

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
This issue has been identified within the `_setBeneficiaries` function of the **CryptoLegacyBasePlugin** contract.

A malicious beneficiary can exploit the beneficiary removal process. If the owner submits a transaction to remove a beneficiary by setting their `shareBps` to 0, the targeted beneficiary can observe this transaction in the mempool and front-run it by calling `beneficiarySwitch`. This moves their beneficiary configuration to a different hash identifier *before* the owner's transaction is processed.

When the owner's `setBeneficiaries` transaction executes, it attempts to adjust the share sum based on the *original* beneficiary hash. Since the beneficiary has switched their hash, the internal accounting for the total `shareSum` becomes incorrect. This causes the check ensuring the sum equals `SHARE_BASE` to fail and revert the transaction.

The issue is classified as **Medium** severity because it allows a malicious beneficiary to prevent their own removal via front-running, thus disrupting a core governance mechanism.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend modifying `setBeneficiaries` to identify beneficiaries for removal using a stable identifier (e.g., original  hash) that is resistant to changes via `beneficiarySwitch`.
> **Client's Commentary:**
> This issue has been fully resolved â€” we implemented internal protections to ensure that front-running via beneficiarySwitch no longer disrupts the setBeneficiaries logic or causes unintended reverts.

#### 3. Owner Can Reset Challenge Timer and Evade Update Fee

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
This issue has been identified within the `resetGuardianVoting` function of the **TrustedGuardiansPlugin** contract.

The owner can call `resetGuardianVoting` to reset the `distributionStartAt` timer, effectively cancelling a pending challenge initiated by beneficiaries due to owner inactivity. Crucially, this reset does not require the owner to pay the update fee normally associated with resolving such a challenge. This allows the owner to repeatedly avoid inactivity penalties and associated fees.

The issue is classified as **Medium** severity because it undermines the economic incentive designed to ensure owner liveness, breaking a core part of the challenge mechanism.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend requiring the update fee payment within `resetGuardianVoting` if a beneficiary challenge is active, or decoupling the challenge state management between `TrustedGuardiansPlugin` and `CryptoLegacyBasePlugin`.
> **Client's Commentary:**
> This issue has been fully resolved â€” we have added update fee enforcement to the resetGuardianVoting function when it is called during an active challenge period, ensuring alignment with the intended incentive structure.

#### 4. Integer Overflow in Default Guardian Confirmations Calculation

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/137d597231a13c1d4951dfb847581d7ba577d369
##### Description
An integer overflow can occur when computing the default number of confirmations required for guardian votes. The code unconditionally casts the length of the guardian set (a `uint256`) to `uint8` before passing it into `LibSafeMinimalMultisig._calcDefaultConfirmations`:

```solidity
uint8(
    LibSafeMinimalMultisig._calcDefaultConfirmations(
        uint8(
            guardians.length())))
```

If there are 256 or more guardians (or, when no explicit guardians are set, beneficiaries), the `uint8` cast wraps the length modulo 256 (e.g. 256â†’0, 257â†’1), causing `_calcDefaultConfirmations` to return an incorrect threshold (e.g. for 0 â†’ 1 confirmation required). This breaks the intended multisig-majority logic.

For example:
- With **256 guardians**, `uint8(guardians.length())` becomes `0`, so the threshold becomes `(0 / 2) + 1 = 1`;
- With **257 guardians**, the length wraps to `1`, resulting in `(1 / 2) + 1 = 1`.

In both cases, only a **single signature** is enough to meet the threshold â€” defeating the security purpose of a multisig setup.

While having â‰¥256 guardians or beneficiaries is a highly unlikely scenario in most real-world deployments, it is theoretically possible, and nothing in the current code prevents it.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend refactoring the confirmation calculation logic to use a data type that can safely accommodate a sufficiently large number of participantsâ€”such that the practical limit on guardians or beneficiaries can never cause overflow. We recommend using at least `uint32` for both the input and output of the threshold calculation:

```solidity
function _calcDefaultConfirmations(uint32 _voterCount)
    internal
    pure
    returns (uint32)
{
    return (_voterCount / 2) + 1;
}
```

#### 5. Incorrect `lastBalance` update in treasury token transfer for rebasing tokens

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/d79ade5f5a9f41314780ee99a8e38ff8351bf75f
##### Description
In the `LibCryptoLegacy` libraryâ€™s `_transferTreasuryTokensToLegacy` function, `td.lastBalance` is updated by adding the difference between the post-transfer balance and the prior balance. This logic miscalculates `lastBalance` under rebasing tokens, leading to incorrect negative rebase handling.
For example, assume after the previous claim `td.lastBalance` is 1,000. A positive rebase increases the contractâ€™s token balance to 1,100. Then, a treasury transfer of 1,000 tokens raises the balance to 2,100. The code sets `td.lastBalance = 1000 + (2100 â€“ 1100) = 2000` instead of the actual 2,100. If a subsequent 0.5% negative rebase reduces the actual balance to 2,089.5, the stale `td.lastBalance` (2,000) is below the new balance, causing `_tokenPrepareToDistribute` to detect a negative rebase and incorrectly increase the recorded `totalClaimed`, reducing future claimable amounts for beneficiaries. 

This misallocation violates vesting invariants when rebasing tokens are involved, warranting **Medium** severity because it corrupts distribution without enabling direct asset theft.
<br/>
##### Recommendation

We recommend reverting the `lastBalance` update to the previous implementation:

```diff
-    td.lastBalance += IERC20(_tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)) 
-                      - balanceBefore;
+    td.lastBalance = IERC20(_tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
```

This change ensures `lastBalance` always matches the actual post-transfer balance and prevents erroneous claim adjustments caused by rebasing.

### 2.4 Low

#### 1. Manual Role Renounce Leads to `SignatureRoleTimelock` Inconsistency

##### Status 
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
A role is granted to a user during the `SignatureRoleTimelock.setRoleAccounts` call. However, the user can call [AccessControl.renounceRole](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/d00acef4059807535af0bd0dd0ddf619747a044b/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol#L179-L183), which creates two issues:

1. The admin cannot remove this user from `roleAccounts` using `SignatureRoleTimelock.setRoleAccounts` due to a [hasRole](https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/blob/e409929501d5b78941bc78411f1fa3da36249a94/contracts/SignatureRoleTimelock.sol#L169-L170) check. This causes a temporary denial of service in role management. The admin must first call [AccessControl.grantRole](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/d00acef4059807535af0bd0dd0ddf619747a044b/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol#L144-L146) before the user can be removed.
2. The admin may **mistakenly** add a user to the **roleAccounts** after they have renounced their role, leading to duplicated entries. Removing the user clears only one instance, requiring extra steps to fully clean up.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend restricting users from calling `AccessControl.renounceRole`.

#### 2. Unnecessary `renounceOwnership` Function

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
The `CryptoLegacyBasePlugin` contract includes a standard [renounceOwnership](https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/blob/e409929501d5b78941bc78411f1fa3da36249a94/contracts/plugins/CryptoLegacyBasePlugin.sol#L177-L179) function, allowing the owner to transfer ownership to the zero address.

In the context of **CryptoLegacy**, where ownership governs sensitive operations such as beneficiary configuration, fee management, and recovery logic, removing the owner can lead to an irrecoverable loss of control over critical features. From a business logic perspective, it is unlikely that a legitimate owner would intentionally relinquish these capabilities, as doing so would undermine the purpose of maintaining control over their digital legacy.

Moreover, when a `CryptoLegacy` instance is initialized, the **owner** is [registered](https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/blob/e409929501d5b78941bc78411f1fa3da36249a94/contracts/libraries/LibCryptoLegacy.sol#L395-L396) in the `BeneficiaryRegistry` contract. However, when the owner calls `CryptoLegacyBasePlugin.renounceOwnership`, their ownership is [not cleared](https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/blob/e409929501d5b78941bc78411f1fa3da36249a94/contracts/CryptoLegacyOwnable.sol#L31-L35) from the `BeneficiaryRegistry.cryptoLegacyByOwner`, resulting in an inconsistency between the pluginâ€™s internal state and the registry.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend removing the `renounceOwnership` function.

#### 3. `transfer` method is used instead of `call`

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
This issue has been identified in Ether-sending functions like `payInitialFee` and `_sendFeeByTransfer` (within **CryptoLegacyBasePlugin** / **LibCryptoLegacy**).

Using `transfer` forwards only 2300 gas. This fixed limit is often insufficient for recipient smart contracts (e.g., multisigs, bridges, contracts with complex receive logic), causing the Ether transfer to fail.

The issue is classified as **Low** severity as it affects interoperability and robustness rather than causing direct asset loss.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend using the low-level `call` method instead of `transfer` and apply reentrancy protection.

#### 4. Execution Order Race Condition in `SignatureRoleTimelock`

##### Status
Acknowledged
##### Description
The `SignatureRoleTimelock.executeCallList` function allows anyone to [execute](https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/blob/e409929501d5b78941bc78411f1fa3da36249a94/contracts/SignatureRoleTimelock.sol#L333-L337) scheduled calls after their timelock period expires. However, there is no mechanism to enforce execution order of related calls. If multiple dependent calls are scheduled with overlapping timelock periods, this can lead to execution in an unintended order, potentially compromising security or causing logical errors if calls were designed to be executed in a specific sequence.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend restricting execution to authorized users only and enforcing the correct execution order of scheduled calls.

> **Client's Commentary:**
> We acknowledge the finding, but we do not consider this a vulnerability. The executeCallList function is intentionally designed to allow flexible execution after timelock expiry, without enforcing a strict call order. This is by design: CryptoLegacy contracts do not rely on sequential execution of time-locked operations. All privileged actions are intended to be independent and safe to execute in any order. If a future use case requires enforcing execution order (e.g., composable governance flows), this can be easily achieved by assigning non-overlapping timelock durations to dependent calls. Therefore, the system offers maximum flexibility without hardcoding assumptions about call relationships. As such, we treat this as expected behavior, not a security concern.

#### 5. `TrustedGuardiansPlugin._setGuardiansConfig` should have a below bound check for `guardiansChallengeTimeout`

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
In the `TrustedGuardiansPlugin` contract, the `guardiansChallengeTimeout` parameter lacks a lower bound check and only enforces an [upper bound](https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/blob/e409929501d5b78941bc78411f1fa3da36249a94/contracts/plugins/TrustedGuardiansPlugin.sol#L241-L243). As a result, the owner may not have sufficient time to react if the timeout is set to zero.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend adding a check to enforce a reasonable lower bound for the `guardiansChallengeTimeout` parameter.

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description

#### 7. Gas Inefficiency Due to Linear Searches in View Functions

##### Status
Acknowledged
##### Description
This issue has been identified within several view or pure functions across multiple contracts and libraries, including:
* `_isVoterAllowed`, `_getConfirmedCount`, `_isMethodAllowed` in **LibSafeMinimalMultisig**;
* `_getAddressIndex`, `_getBytes4Index` in **SignatureRoleTimelock**;
* `_findFacetBySelector` in **LibCryptoLegacyPlugins**;
* and `_isGuardianVoted` in **TrustedGuardiansPlugin**.

These functions use inefficient O(n) loops to search through arrays (e.g., lists of voters, allowed methods, guardians, facets). For large arrays, these searches consume excessive gas, potentially making data retrieval costly or impossible for other contracts or off-chain scripts calling them.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend refactoring these linear searches to use more efficient data structures. Mappings (`mapping(key => value)` or `mapping(key => bool)`) provide O(1) lookup complexity. For scenarios requiring iteration, consider OpenZeppelin's `EnumerableSet` library for O(1) lookups and enumeration capabilities.
> **Client's Commentary:**
> Due to the small and limited number of elements, it was decided not to waste extra gas on writing to the mapping, since doing so can cost more than iterating over the small number of elements. In `_findFacetBySelector`, special caching occurs in the mapping whenever possible. Recording all selectors in the mapping when deploying a contract is too expensive.

#### 8. Weak Privacy Due to Hash-Only Identity Obfuscation

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
To preserve user privacy, the system obscures Ethereum addresses by storing only their Keccak-256 hashes. While in theory it is computationally infeasible to recover a random 160-bit address from its Keccak hash, this assumption overlooks a critical **practical limitation**.

In practice, there is no value in protecting addresses that have never interacted with the blockchain. Realistically, privacy is only relevant for **active addresses** â€” and the global set of such addresses is relatively small and enumerable (e.g., all addresses that ever sent or received transactions). An attacker can precompute the Keccak hashes of all such addresses and perform a **lookup attack**, potentially deanonymizing participants.

This undermines the intended privacy goal: hashes alone **do not provide sufficient anonymity** for active accounts.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
Instead of using `keccak256(address)` as a standalone identifier, derive user identity from a combination of address and a secret salt:

```solidity
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(address, salt))
```

The salt should be generated client-side and stored off-chain. It is only revealed at the moment of authorization or voting. Without knowledge of the salt, an attacker cannot match a hash to a known address, even if the address is on a precomputed list.

This approach provides **semantic privacy**: even active addresses cannot be linked to their hashed identity without voluntary disclosure.

#### 9. `lastUpdateAt` Can Be Updated by Non-Owner

##### Status
Acknowledged
##### Description
In the `CryptoLegacyBasePlugin.payInitialFee` function, [this line](https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/blob/e409929501d5b78941bc78411f1fa3da36249a94/contracts/plugins/CryptoLegacyBasePlugin.sol#L214) updates the **lastUpdateAt** timestamp.

However, it is executed unconditionally, regardless of who calls the function. This allows any external address to call `CryptoLegacyBasePlugin.payInitialFee` and refresh the **lastUpdateAt** value, even if the caller is not the owner of the legacy.

This behavior is problematic because **lastUpdateAt** is presumably used as a liveness indicator. If any account can update this value, it undermines the reliability of death detection mechanisms that rely on it.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend restricting the `CryptoLegacyBasePlugin.payInitialFee` function to the contract owner:

```solidity
if (msg.sender != owner()) revert NotOwner();
```

Do not use the `onlyOwner` modifier here, as its internal `_checkOwner()` implementation checks whether `lastFeePaidAt != 0`, which would conflict with this functionâ€™s own `lastFeePaidAt == 0` requirement.

> **Client's Commentary:**
> The lastUpdateAt timestamp can only be updated once after contract creation and before it is actively used. Because of this one-time update constraintâ€”combined with the fact that our front-end does not allow token approvals to crypto legacy address before first paymentâ€”there is no ongoing vulnerability regarding repeated updates or spoofing of liveness checks.

#### 10. Missing Sanity Check for `guardiansThreshold`


##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
`TrustedGuardiansPlugin._setGuardiansConfig` [sets](https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/blob/e409929501d5b78941bc78411f1fa3da36249a94/contracts/plugins/TrustedGuardiansPlugin.sol#L244) the **guardiansThreshold** without validating whether the threshold is consistent with the number of currently assigned guardians.

As a result, the threshold can be set to a value higher than the number of guardians, temporarily making it impossible to reach quorum in guardian-based processes such as recovery approvals.

However, since the owner retains the ability to update both the guardian list and the threshold, this situation does **not result in a permanent lockout** and can be corrected by the owner.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend adding a validation to ensure **guardiansThreshold** is within valid bounds at the time it is set.

#### 11. Redundant Casting in Function Selector Retrieval

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
In the `getSigs` functions, selectors are retrieved using an explicit cast to the contract's type:

```solidity
sigs[0] = TrustedGuardiansPlugin(address(this)).initializeGuardians.selector;
```

This cast is unnecessary. In Solidity 0.8.x and above, it is valid and more concise to use:

```solidity
sigs[0] = this.initializeGuardians.selector;
```

Both forms produce the exact same `bytes4` function selector. The cast to `TrustedGuardiansPlugin(address(this))` adds no functional benefit and reduces readability. The `this.` prefix already performs an external call context and resolves the selector properly.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
Simplify the expression by removing the explicit cast:

```solidity
sigs[0] = this.initializeGuardians.selector;
```

Apply this replacement consistently for all selector assignments.

#### 14. Hard-Coded Gas Limits Risk Future Compatibility

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/137d597231a13c1d4951dfb847581d7ba577d369
##### Description
This issue has been identified in multiple functions using hard-coded gas limits for external calls.

These fixed limits (e.g., `1e5`) may become insufficient if Ethereum gas costs change or if the external contracts require more gas in the future. This could cause these calls to fail, breaking core functionality.

The issue is classified as **Low** severity as it represents a future compatibility risk rather than an immediate flaw.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend replacing hard-coded gas limits for external calls with forwarding all available gas, or alternatively, using configurable gas stipends.
> **Client's Commentary:**
> MixBytes: In `LibCryptoLegacy._isLifetimeActiveAndUpdate`, the gas limit for the call to `isLifetimeNftLockedAndUpdate` was reduced from `6e5` to `2e5`. We recommend reverting it to the previous value.

#### 15. Unused or Duplicate Imports Increase Deployment Cost

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
This issue has been identified across multiple contracts:
* **CryptoLegacyBasePlugin** imports `Pausable.sol` but does not appear to use its functionality.
* **LegacyRecoveryPlugin** imports `LibDiamond.sol` and `IERC721.sol`, which seem unused within the plugin's logic.
* **CryptoLegacyOwnable** includes duplicate imports for `LibCryptoLegacy.sol`.

Importing unused contracts/libraries or duplicating imports increases the contract bytecode size and deployment gas costs unnecessarily.

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
This issue has been identified within `try...catch` blocks in **LibCryptoLegacy**, particularly around external calls (e.g., registry updates).

Empty `catch {}` blocks are used, which silently ignore any errors occurring during the `try` block. This practice hides potential runtime problems and makes debugging difficult.

#### 17. Hard-coded Values Reduce Readability

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
This issue involves the direct use of literal numeric values ('magic numbers') instead of named constants in various contracts:
* Time durations (e.g., `7 days`, `30 days`) in **SignatureRoleTimelock.sol** and **TrustedGuardiansPlugin.sol**.
* Basis points denominator (`10000`) in **LibCryptoLegacy.sol** and **CryptoLegacyBasePlugin.sol**.
* An array length limit (`100`) in **LibCryptoLegacy.sol**.

Using magic numbers makes the code harder to read, as the purpose of the number isn't immediately clear. It also increases the risk of errors during maintenance, as changing a value requires finding every instance.
<br/>
##### Recommendation

#### 18. Minor Gas Inefficiencies via Redundant Operations

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
This issue identifies minor inefficiencies in several functions:
- In **SignatureRoleTimelock** `_getAddressIndex` and `_getBytes4Index` continue iterating even after the index is found.
* In **LibCryptoLegacy**, the `_tokenPrepareToDistribute` function contains logic for calculating `amountToDistribute` involving balance and allowance checks that can be simplified to a single assign `td.amountToDistribute = bal + td.totalClaimedAmount;`.
* In **LibCryptoLegacyPlugins**, the `_findFacetBySelector` function iterates through all facets even if a match is found early instead of returning immediately.
* In **LibCryptoLegacy** `_transferTreasuryTokensToLegacy` uses a nested `for` loop. It's better to skip the iteration if the balance is zero and avoid unnecessary transfers.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend refactoring the identified code sections for minor gas savings, primarily by returning early from search loops once an item is found.

#### 19. Timelock Duration Check Missing, Allows Near-Zero Delay

##### Status
Acknowledged
##### Description
This issue has been identified within the `_addSignatureRole` function of the **SignatureRoleTimelock** contract.

The function allows setting a role's timelock duration without enforcing a minimum value. This permits setting a timelock of just 1 second, undermining the intended security purpose of providing a meaningful delay before execution.

The issue is classified as **Low** severity as it's a configuration weakness exploitable only by privileged users, but it bypasses an intended safeguard.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend adding a `require` statement in `_addSignatureRole` to enforce a sensible minimum timelock duration:

```solidity
require(_timelock >= 1 hours, "Timelock too short");
```
> **Client's Commentary:**
> We intentionally allow the main administrator to set near-zero timelocks to enable quick role configuration when operational needs require it. This flexibility is restricted to privileged users only, ensuring that any short timelock usage remains under controlled circumstances.

#### 20. Unvalidated `_refShare` Can Cause Reverts

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e
##### Description
This issue has been identified within the `_takeFee` function of the **LibCryptoLegacy** library.

The function uses `_refShare` to calculate a referral fee but doesn't check if `_refShare` exceeds `SHARE_BASE` (10000). An invalid `_refShare` (> 10000) can cause an arithmetic underflow during the owner's share calculation, leading to transaction reverts.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend adding validation before calculating fees involving `_refShare`.
```solidity
require(_ref == address(0) || _refShare <= SHARE_BASE, "Invalid ref share");
```

#### 21. Standard `ReentrancyGuard` Inheritance Risks Diamond Storage Collision

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/d3ae300a8e07374b425408e84e1101a18a39d4f4
##### Description
This issue applies to Diamond plugins **LegacyRecoveryPlugin**, **CryptoLegacyBasePlugin**, **TrustedGuardianPlugin** inheriting the standard `ReentrancyGuard`.

Standard `ReentrancyGuard` uses storage slot 0 for its **status** variable. In a Diamond proxy, storage slots are shared across all facets. If another facet deployed to the Diamond also uses slot 0, their storage variables will collide, leading to corrupted state or potentially disabled re-entrancy protection.

The issue is classified as **Low** severity as it represents a latent compatibility risk within the Diamond pattern, which could cause critical issues if conflicting facets are added later.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend using `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` from OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts library, as it is designed to avoid storage collisions in proxy patterns like Diamond.
> **Client's Commentary:**
> MixBytes: `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` was introduced, however `__ReentrancyGuard_init` function is never called. We recommend initializing via this function. 
> Client: https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/36c75d8528ac3685bf18196a03a01d5072d33644
> MixBytes: `SignatureRoleTimelock` is not an upgradeable contract. However, it inherits from `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` and calls `__ReentrancyGuard_init` in the constructor. We recommend using the non-upgradeable version of `ReentrancyGuard` instead, and removing the `__ReentrancyGuard_init` call.

#### 22. Incorrect Handling of Beneficiary Votes in TrustedGuardiansPlugin

##### Status
Acknowledged
##### Description
When no guardians are explicitly configured in the TrustedGuardiansPlugin, the plugin defaults to using the list of CryptoLegacy beneficiaries as guardians.

In this setup, a beneficiary can call `beneficiarySwitch` to change their address and potentially vote multiple times. Fortunately, the contract correctly filters out votes from stale (previous) beneficiary addresses when evaluating quorum, so quorum triggering is not affected.

However, public view functions that return voting information may still include these outdated votes, making the results counterintuitive and misleading. For example, a vote cast via a stale address may initially appear in the list of votes, only to disappear later when someone else votes â€” leading to confusion about the actual state of voting.

Although this behavior does not impact the integrity of quorum calculation, it may cause off-chain clients or observers to misinterpret the voting status.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend reviewing public view functions that expose voting data, and considering adjustments to ensure they return only valid and up-to-date votes â€” i.e., votes associated with the currently active guardian or beneficiary addresses.

> **Client's Commentary:**
> MixBytes: `TrustedGuardiansPlugin.getGuardiansData` still behaves unexpectedly in some conditions: A beneficiary votes, and then `getGuardiansData` returns that the beneficiary voted. The beneficiary then makes a switch, but `getGuardiansData` still returns that the beneficiary voted (under their old hash). After that, another beneficiary votes, and `getGuardiansData` returns that the beneficiary who made the switch did not vote â€” i.e., the number of voters remains unchanged after the new vote appears because the old vote was removed. This does not affect consensus, because quorum is triggered after the vote and cleanup occurs before that; however, the `getGuardiansData` getter currently returns inconsistent data. Additionally, the `checkGuardiansVotedAndGetGuardiansData` function has been introduced to provide accurate and up-to-date voting data, addressing this issue without altering the existing `getGuardiansData` view function.

#### 23. Beneficiary Can Avoid Paying Protocol Fees

##### Status
Acknowledged
##### Description
There are two issues in the fee payment mechanism for beneficiaries when calling `CryptoLegacyBasePlugin.beneficiaryClaim`:

1. Beneficiaries can completely avoid paying fees when claiming tokens if the distribution has already started. This can happen because, when [\_isDistributionStarted](https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/blob/e409929501d5b78941bc78411f1fa3da36249a94/contracts/libraries/LibCryptoLegacy.sol#L210-L212) returns **true**, the function updates `lastFeePaidAt`, and inside `LibCryptoLegacy._sendFeeByTransfer`, there's an early exit if [msg.value == 0](https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/blob/e409929501d5b78941bc78411f1fa3da36249a94/contracts/libraries/LibCryptoLegacy.sol#L270-L272). As a result, beneficiaries can call `CryptoLegacyBasePlugin.beneficiaryClaim` with zero payment and still receive their tokens.
2. Even when beneficiaries do provide payment, they can redirect 100% of the fee to a referral address instead of the protocol by using the maximum **\_refShare** value (SHARE_BASE = 10000).
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend making the following changes:

1. Add proper fee validation in the `LibCryptoLegacy._sendFeeByTransfer` function to ensure that beneficiaries cannot claim without paying the required fee.
2. Prevent beneficiaries from manually providing a referral address and share percentage. The referral mechanism should be fully managed by the system to prevent abuse or fee redirection.

> **Client's Commentary:**
> We intentionally designed the beneficiaryClaim fee as a voluntary donation rather than a strict requirement. This ensures that beneficiaries can always access their tokens, especially during critical inheritance scenarios. We consider the severity of this issue to be Low, not Medium, for the following reasons: The contract avoids reverts related to fee logic to guarantee that beneficiaries can claim their assets without risk of failure. The early exit on msg.value == 0 is an intentional mechanism to provide fault-tolerant behavior in cases where users or interfaces fail to include a fee. Our frontend includes the appropriate fee and referral parameters by default, so under standard usage, the DAO still receives the expected contribution. Users are free to omit the fee or assign 100% of it to a referral address â€” this is consistent with the donation-based model and does not impact protocol correctness or security. The fee mechanism exists to support protocol sustainability, not to enforce payment through mandatory contract-level constraints. Given that this behavior is intentional, carries no functional risk, and enhances accessibility in sensitive use cases, we consider the issue to be Low severity.

#### 24. Operations Allowed on Proposals with `NOT_EXIST` Status

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/36c75d8528ac3685bf18196a03a01d5072d33644
##### Description
The `LibSafeMinimalMultisig._getPendingProposalForVoter` function does not validate whether the provided `_proposalId` falls within the bounds of the `proposals` array. The function only checks whether the proposal status is not `EXECUTED` or `CANCELED`, but still allows operations on proposals with the `NOT_EXIST` status, which is the default value for uninitialized entries.

As a result, the following problematic scenarios may occur:

- Invoking `LegacyRecoveryPlugin.lrConfirm` with an arbitrary proposal ID that does not exist in the array may result in the creation and immediate execution of a phantom proposal, especially if the threshold is set to 1.
- Combining a call to `LegacyRecoveryPlugin.lrConfirm` followed by `LegacyRecoveryPlugin.lrCancel` may allow setting the status of a non-existent proposal to `CANCELED`, manipulating internal state and potentially causing inconsistencies.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend allowing confirmation and cancellation operations only for proposals that exist and have a `PENDING` status.

#### 25. Inconsistent Native Value Handling in LegacyRecoveryPlugin

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/36c75d8528ac3685bf18196a03a01d5072d33644
##### Description
The `LegacyRecoveryPlugin.lrResetGuardianVoting` function is marked as `payable`, indicating it expects to receive native value. However, the `LegacyRecoveryPlugin.lrPropose` and `LegacyRecoveryPlugin.lrConfirm` functions do not support native value transfers. As a result, for `lrResetGuardianVoting` to receive funds, the value must be sent directly to the `CryptoLegacy` contract address beforehand. This leads to a fragmented funding model where some operations require pre-funding the contract.

In cases where `lrResetGuardianVoting` is the target selector in a proposal, the execution of `LegacyRecoveryPlugin.lrPropose` and `LegacyRecoveryPlugin.lrConfirm` may fail if there is no native value present on the `CryptoLegacy` contract.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend implementing a consistent approach that allows sending native value with function calls, without requiring prior funding of the contract.

> **Client's Commentary:**
> Client: https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/36c75d8528ac3685bf18196a03a01d5072d33644
> MixBytes: The issue was fixed. Two functions â€” `LegacyRecoveryPlugin.lrPropose` and `LegacyRecoveryPlugin.lrConfirm` â€” were marked as payable; however, this change introduced a new issue, described in finding L-27.

#### 26. Premature Owner Update in Beneficiary Registry During Ownership Transfer

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/36c75d8528ac3685bf18196a03a01d5072d33644
##### Description
In the `CryptoLegacyBasePlugin.transferOwnership` function the `_updateOwnerInBeneficiaryRegistry` function is [called](https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/blob/4558f24ad5c9aecf41751643e7e2ce9b1686092e/contracts/plugins/CryptoLegacyBasePlugin.sol#L183) before ownership is actually transferred. This may lead to a state inconsistency within the `BeneficiaryRegistry` contract, where it reflects an owner different from the actual one defined by the ownership logic.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend moving the call to `LibCryptoLegacy._updateOwnerInBeneficiaryRegistry` into the `CryptoLegacyOwnable.acceptOwnership` function to ensure that the beneficiary registry reflects the effective owner only after ownership is accepted.

#### 27. Improper Handling of Payable Proposals

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/d3ae300a8e07374b425408e84e1101a18a39d4f4
##### Description
An issue has been identified in the `LegacyRecoveryPlugin`.
The `LegacyRecoveryPlugin.lrPropose` and `LegacyRecoveryPlugin.lrConfirm` functions are marked as `payable`. This design was implemented for consistency, allowing voters to transfer funds to execute proposals that require payment, such as those using the `lrResetGuardianVoting` selector.
However, this implementation has several flaws:
1. If `requiredConfirmations > 1`, multiple voters can send value for the same proposal, but only the `msg.value` from the final confirming transaction is actually forwarded during execution. Funds from earlier payments remain locked in the contract.
2. If a proposal that required payment is subsequently cancelled, the transferred funds remain locked in the contract with no withdrawal mechanism.
3. Voters can send funds when proposing operations that do not require payment (e.g., `lrTransferTreasuryTokensToLegacy`, `lrWithdrawTokensFromLegacy`).
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend the following:
1. Implement a mechanism that allows voters to reclaim their funds if a proposal has been cancelled.
2. Remove the `payable` modifier from the `lrConfirm` function.
3. Modify the proposal struct to store the payerâ€™s address and the paid amount.
4. Allow only one payment per proposal (i.e., a single actual fee).
5. Add checks to disallow payments for proposals whose selector does not require payment.

#### 28. Incorrect handling of fee-on-transfer and rebasing tokens penalizes single beneficiary

##### Status
Fixed in https://github.com/CryptoCust/cryptolegacy-contracts/commit/fc6242e7ab7d8c24a0bf7e426ca2c8d5cc1f3c1a
##### Description
In the `CryptoLegacyBasePlugin` contract's internal `_claimTokenWithVesting` function, when `balanceExpected` (post-transfer balance minus claimed amount) is less than `balanceBefore`, for instance due to a negative rebase inside the transfer or a fee-on-transfer token, the code increments only the single claiming beneficiary's `tokenAmountClaimed` by the deficit and then calls `_tokenPrepareToDistribute`. This adjustment wrongly assigns the entire shortfall to one beneficiary rather than distributing it proportionally across all beneficiaries, resulting in unfair vesting.

Here, fee-on-transfer tokens refer to tokens that deduct an extra fee from the senderâ€™s balance in addition to the transferred amount. Such tokens are already unsupported by `_transferTreasuryTokensToLegacy` (which retrieves full balances or allowances, causing such fee-on-transfer transfers to revert), so adding special handling here complicates the logic unnecessarily.

Furthermore, because the code increments `bv.tokenAmountClaimed` before invoking `_tokenPrepareToDistribute`, the subsequent `balanceDiff` calculation within `_tokenPrepareToDistribute` always evaluates to zero. As a result, the function returns without changing any storage, rendering this adjustment logic effectively a no-op and adding unnecessary complexity without any state change.
##### Recommendation
We recommend removing the deficit-adjustment block to restore original behavior and suggesting to users to rely on wrapped variants of nonstandard tokens if needed. Specifically, delete:

```diff
-        if (balanceExpected < balanceBefore) {
-          bv.tokenAmountClaimed[_token] += (balanceBefore - balanceExpected);
-          LibCryptoLegacy._tokenPrepareToDistribute(cls, _token);
-        }
```

Reverting this change does not risk losing tokens for users: even if fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens remain unsupported, any extra fees or rebasing during transfer will reduce total distributable tokens, but assets will not be lost and will still be distributedâ€”albeit with minor fairness variations. Given these token behaviors are atypical, this tradeoff is acceptable.
