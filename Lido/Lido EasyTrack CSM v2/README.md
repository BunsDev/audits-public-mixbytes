# Lido Easy Track CSM v2 Security Audit Report

###### tags: `LIDO`

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Disclaimer
The audit makes no statements or warranties regarding the utility, safety, or security of the code, the suitability of the business model, investment advice, endorsement of the platform or its products, the regulatory regime for the business model, or any other claims about the fitness of the contracts for a particular purpose or their bug-free status. 
    
### 1.2 Executive Summary
The CSMSetVettedGateTree contract is an Easy Track EVMScript factory designed to update the Merkle tree configuration of a VettedGate contract used by the Community Staking Module v2 (CSM). It enables a trusted caller to generate an EVMScript that calls the `setTreeParams` function on VettedGate, supplying a new Merkle tree root and CID. This facilitates governance actions to be executed on-chain via Easy Track motions.

The audit was conducted over 3 days by 4 auditors.

During the audit the following attack vectors were checked:

1. **Access Control:** The `onlyTrustedCaller` modifier enforces strict access to EVMScript creation, preventing unauthorized use.

2. **Tree Root and CID Validation:** The contract enforces strict checks to ensure that both the new treeRoot and treeCid are non-empty and differ from the currently set values.

3. **Correct Encoding of setTreeParams Call:** The contract securely generates the EVMScript payload by combining the `setTreeParams` function selector with the supplied `_evmScriptCallData`. The encoding is consistent with the target function’s signature, enabling predictable on-chain execution.

The VettedGate contract, which is the target of the generated EVMScript, was out of the scope of this audit.

The contract is well-structured, with clear access control, thorough input validation, and secure EVMScript construction, reflecting a high standard of code quality.

### 1.4 Security Assessment Methodology
    
#### Project Flow

| **Stage** | **Scope of Work** |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Interim Audit** | **Project Architecture Review:**<br> - Review project documentation <br> - Conduct a general code review <br> - Perform reverse engineering to analyze the project’s architecture based solely on the source code <br> - Develop an independent perspective on the project’s architecture <br> - Identify any logical flaws in the design <br> **Objective:** Understand the overall structure of the project and identify potential security risks. |
| **Interim Audit** | **Core Review with a Hacker Mindset:**<br> - Each team member independently conducts a manual code review, focusing on identifying unique vulnerabilities. <br> - Perform collaborative audits (pair auditing) of the most complex code sections, supervised by the Team Lead. <br> - Develop Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) and conduct fuzzing tests using tools like Foundry, Hardhat, and BOA to uncover intricate logical flaws. <br> - Review test cases and in-code comments to identify potential weaknesses. <br> **Objective:** Identify and eliminate the majority of vulnerabilities, including those unique to the industry. |
| **Interim Audit** | **Code Review with a Nerd Mindset:**<br> - Conduct a manual code review using an internally maintained checklist, regularly updated with insights from past hacks, research, and client audits. <br> - Utilize static analysis tools (e.g., Slither, Mythril) and vulnerability databases (e.g., Solodit) to uncover potential undetected attack vectors. <br> **Objective:** Ensure comprehensive coverage of all known attack vectors during the review process. |
| **Interim Audit** | **Consolidation of Auditors' Reports:**<br> - Cross-check findings among auditors <br> - Discuss identified issues <br> - Issue an interim audit report for client review <br> **Objective:** Combine interim reports from all auditors into a single comprehensive document. |
| **Re-Audit** | **Bug Fixing & Re-Audit:**<br> - The client addresses the identified issues and provides feedback. <br> - Auditors verify the fixes and update their statuses with supporting evidence. <br> - A re-audit report is generated and shared with the client. <br> **Objective:** Validate the fixes and reassess the code to ensure all vulnerabilities are resolved and no new vulnerabilities are added. |
| **Final Audit** | **Final Code Verification & Public Audit Report:**<br> - Verify the final code version against recommendations and their statuses. <br> - Check deployed contracts for correct initialization parameters. <br> - Confirm that the deployed code matches the audited version. <br> - Issue a public audit report, published on our official GitHub repository. <br> - Announce the successful audit on our official X account. <br> **Objective:** Perform a final review and issue a public report documenting the audit. |

### 1.5 Risk Classification

#### Severity Level Matrix

| Severity  | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical   | High    | Medium  |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High       | Medium  | Low     |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium     | Low     | Low     |

#### Impact

- **High** – Theft from 0.5% OR partial/full blocking of funds (>0.5%) on the contract without the possibility of withdrawal OR loss of user funds (>1%) who interacted with the protocol.
- **Medium** – Contract lock that can only be fixed through a contract upgrade OR one-time theft of rewards or an amount up to 0.5% of the protocol's TVL OR funds lock with the possibility of withdrawal by an admin.
- **Low** – One-time contract lock that can be fixed by the administrator without a contract upgrade.

#### Likelihood

- **High** – The event has a 50-60% probability of occurring within a year and can be triggered by any actor (e.g., due to a likely market condition that the actor cannot influence).
- **Medium** – An unlikely event (10-20% probability of occurring) that can be triggered by a trusted actor.
- **Low** – A highly unlikely event that can only be triggered by the owner.

#### Action Required

- **Critical** – Must be fixed as soon as possible.
- **High** – Strongly advised to be fixed to minimize potential risks.
- **Medium** – Recommended to be fixed to enhance security and stability.
- **Low** – Recommended to be fixed to improve overall robustness and effectiveness.

#### Finding Status

- **Fixed** – The recommended fixes have been implemented in the project code and no longer impact its security.
- **Partially Fixed** – The recommended fixes have been partially implemented, reducing the impact of the finding, but it has not been fully resolved.
- **Acknowledged** – The recommended fixes have not yet been implemented, and the finding remains unresolved or does not require code changes.
